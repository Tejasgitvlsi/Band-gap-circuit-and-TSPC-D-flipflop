# Band-gap-circuit-and-TSPC-D-flipflop
Statement 1. 

Implement TSPC positive edge-triggered D Flip Flop (Follow the Textbook for the design). Compute its setup and hold time. Optimize its power delay product. Compute the maximum operating frequency.

Statement 2. 

Implement a Band Gap reference Circuit, with Vref = 1.2 V, Temp. coefficient < = 200 ppm/0C ( for the worst case). You can use any topology of your choice. Also, show Vout vs. VDD and minimize the effect of supply voltage variation in output voltage.
